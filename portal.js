/* Media26 portal connector.
 *
 * Not every IPTV service speaks Xtream Codes. The three that matter in practice:
 *
 *   1. XTREAM CODES   player_api.php?username=&password=  -> JSON categories + streams.
 *   2. M3U PLAYLIST   get.php?username=&password=&type=m3u_plus, or any .m3u/.m3u8 URL.
 *                     One text file listing every channel. This is what most panels that
 *                     "aren't Xtream" actually serve, including resellers of the same panel.
 *   3. STALKER/MINISTRA  the MAG portal that Smart STB, Eagle, Star and Smart4K emulate.
 *                     Identity is a MAC ADDRESS, not a username: the seller authorises the MAC
 *                     and the box asks the portal for a token, then resolves each channel to a
 *                     one-shot stream URL. Endpoints live under /portal.php or
 *                     /stalker_portal/server/load.php.
 *
 * This module normalises all of them into the shape the app already renders, so the player,
 * favourites, categories and search need no knowledge of where a channel came from.

     "Portal URL" is whatever the provider wrote in their own notes, and in practice it is one of
     half a dozen different things:

       http://host:8080                      the panel root
       http://host:8080/c/                   the MAG portal page a Smart-STB user is given
       http://host/stalker_portal/c/         the same thing on a Ministra install
       http://host:8080/player_api.php       an API file
       http://host:8080/get.php?username=…   the finished M3U link itself

     Every playlist address this app builds is base + '/get.php?…', so the base has to be the panel
     ROOT. Keeping the decoration the seller happened to include is what produced addresses like
     `http://host:8080/c/get.php?username=…`, which exist on no panel anywhere — and the portal HTML
     or 404 that came back was then read as "a security layer is blocking us" on a line where
     nothing was blocking anything. Stripping it is the difference between a working sign-in and an
     unfixable-looking error.

     Returns { root, typed, playlist, username, password }:
       root      the panel root, seller decoration removed — tried FIRST
       typed     origin + the path exactly as typed, for the rare panel really hosted in a subfolder

                 built at all, which is what makes "just paste the M3U link they gave you" work

     A Stalker "cmd" is a player directive, not a bare address: the portal names the engine it

     "mpegts http://…", "ffrt3 http://…", "extension http://…". Which word appears is per-panel and
     the vocabulary is open-ended, so stripping the single literal "ffmpeg " left every other
     prefix attached. The value then failed stalkerPickUrl's ^https?:// test, the link was thrown
     away, and the customer was told "the portal accepted the request but returned no link for
     this title" — about a channel that was working perfectly.

       auto http://198.144.155.34:9101/<hash>/index.m3u8?token=<token>

           loaders already do (see stalkerLoadVod). create_link matches on the exact text the
           portal printed, and a channel is listed as `ffmpeg http://…` — stalkerStreamCmd()
           strips that prefix to make the value usable as a URL elsewhere, so sending only the
           cleaned form asks the portal for a command it never issued. The portal answers
           normally and returns a null link, which surfaces as "the portal accepted the request
           but returned no link for this title" on a channel that is perfectly fine.
           Live was the ONE loader that dropped the raw text; stalkerResolve has always tried
           _stalkerCmdRaw first, so carrying it here is all that was missing. The id is kept for
